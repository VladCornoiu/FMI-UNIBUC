			<h2> Storyline: </h2>
			<p id="Story">
				<h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has invested heavily <br>
				in a device known as a "Bone Density scanner". He feels like he has made these devices. <br>
				However, they do not sell as they are marginally better than the current technology at a much <br>
				higher price. As Gardner tries to figure out how to sell them, his wife leaves him, he loses his <br>
				house, his bank account, and credit cards. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, <br> 
				Gardner is now desperate to find a steady job; he takes on a job as a stockbroker, but before <br>
				he can receive pay, he needs to go through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices. </h4>
